# Smart Planter Assistant

## Project Overview

The Smart Planter Assistant is an innovative system designed to help users monitor and maintain the health of their plants using simulated temperature data and a natural language processing interface. This system uses a combination of modern technologies including MQTT for messaging, a backend server for data processing, and the Gemini LLM API for processing user queries in natural language.

## System Functionality

The Smart Planter Assistant offers the following functionalities:
- **Temperature Simulation:** The system simulates temperature data to mimic the environmental conditions affecting a plant's health.
- **Plant Status Display:** The Streamlit UI displays the plant's status as an emoji that reflects whether the simulated temperature conditions are optimal or not.
- **User Interaction:** Users can interact with the system via a Streamlit-based web interface to ask questions or request care tips, which are processed through the Gemini LLM API using natural language.

## How It Works

The system architecture comprises four main components:
1. **Streamlit UI (Client)**: A user-friendly interface where users can see real-time updates on their plantâ€™s status and interact with the system by submitting queries.
2. **MQTT Broker**: Serves as a central hub for message passing between the UI and the backend server.
3. **Backend Server**: Manages the simulation of temperature data and handles the processing of user queries by interacting with the Gemini LLM API.
4. **Gemini LLM API**: Processes user queries received from the backend server and returns responses in natural language, facilitating a conversational user experience.

## System Architecture Diagram

The included diagram illustrates how each component of the system interacts:
- **Data Flow:** Simulated temperature data is generated by the Backend Server and published to the MQTT Broker, which then forwards this data to the Streamlit UI to update the plant status display. User queries are sent from the Streamlit UI through the MQTT Broker to the Backend Server, where they are processed with the help of the Gemini LLM API. Responses from the LLM are sent back through the MQTT Broker to the Streamlit UI to be displayed to the user.
- **Component Interaction:** Each component's role is clearly defined, with the MQTT Broker facilitating all communications between the user interface and the backend processing units.

## Instructions for Use

To understand the diagram and how information moves through the system:
1. **Review the System Architecture Diagram:** Start with the Streamlit UI and follow the arrows that represent data flow to and from other system components.
2. **Refer to the Component Descriptions:** Each component is annotated with its primary functions and how it interacts with other parts of the system.
3. **Follow the Data Paths:** Notice how data is transmitted through the MQTT Broker to either the Backend Server for processing or directly to the UI for display.

## Conclusion

The Smart Planter Assistant is a cutting-edge tool designed to make plant care more interactive and informed. By integrating temperature simulations with real-time, natural language user interactions, the system provides a unique and effective way to monitor plant health.
